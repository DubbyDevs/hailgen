            <strong>Why Act Fast After a Storm?</strong><br />
            In Texas, most homeowners insurance policies only allow you <strong>a limited time (often 1 year or less!)</strong> to file a claim after hail or storm damage. If you wait too long, you may miss out on getting your roof fully covered. Don’t risk losing your chance—<strong>contact us today for a free inspection and take the stress out of the process!</strong>
